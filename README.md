# Teen Patti (Indian version of Poker)
Teenpatti is an Indian origin card game. The objective of this game is to make the best 3 card hand as per the hand ranking and to maximize the pot (prize pool) before the showdown for you to win. A standard 52-card pack (without the jokers) is used in this game.

## Rules of the game

### Ranking of the card hands from highest to lowest is

1) Trail (three of a kind) : 3 cards of the same rank. AAA is the best hand in the game.
2) Pure Sequence (Straight Flush): Three consecutive cards of the same suit.
3) Sequence (Straight): Three consecutive cards not all in the same suit.
4) Color (Flush): A flush of 3 cards in the same suit, with the highest card winning in the case of a draw.
5) Pair (two of a kind): A pair of 2 cards of the same rank. In case of a draw, the highest-ranking 3rd card will denote the winner.
6) High Card: When neither the dealer nor player has a pair, then the hand with the highest card wins.
